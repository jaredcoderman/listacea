## Idea
Listacea was born because my mom wanted a better way to handle keep track of groceries for the family. I wanted to learn NextJS and it gave me the boost of motivation to do that.

## Features

2. Users can create lists, categories for those lists and items for those categories. There is also an additional section for keeping track of recipes
3. User's can share lists with other emails that have an email signed up.
5. Utilizes webscraping with Cheerio for recipes
6. Integrates ChatGPT functions API to come up with a recipe idea using a few starter ingredients. (Sometimes has hilarious results)
